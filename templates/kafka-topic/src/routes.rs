//! Wiring: collect the `orders` handlers into one `Router`, mounted by `main` via `include_router`.
//!
//! Keeping registration in its own module lets the handlers stay broker-agnostic - the router binds
//! to a concrete broker only when `main` mounts it.

/// Builds the orders router: a publishing handler (replies to the `confirmations` topic) plus a
/// plain one.
///
/// `confirm` needs a publisher for its reply; `TypedPublisher::new` pairs the broker's publisher
/// with the default codec, reused to decode the order. `on_cancel` has no reply, so it is mounted
/// with `include`. The router is a consuming builder, so the calls chain; the registration list is
/// opaque, hence `impl RouterDef`. `use<>` opts out of borrowing `broker` (the router owns its
/// Arc-backed publisher), so `main` can still mutate the scope to mount it.
